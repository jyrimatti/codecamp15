# A Haskell-client for Bots of black friday

## Why?

- We had a code camp. We had a provided game server.
- We had to make a bot to communicate with the server and collect items in different worlds.
- We had initially four but eventually six hours of time.
- We also had beer. And meat balls. 

## What?

## So... how did it go?

- Everyone was having fun.
- The sauna was hot.
- There were bots in different languages (Haskell, Clojure, Elixir, Java, JavaScript).
- I wanted to do Haskell.
- I didn't believe I could finish anything in the given time frame.
- I was happily surprised I could get a working bot up and running, with an A* search.
- The code quality is horrible (god have mercy), but I'll blame the lack of time. And beer.

## Conclusion?

I think this proves that Haskell can indeed be used for quick prototyping.
Take that, dynamic camp!
